ðŸ“Œ Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning & ANN
Built a classification model to predict customer churn using bank data with features like credit score, age, balance, and activity status. Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance. Evaluated models like Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and ANN. After SMOTE, Random Forest achieved 85% accuracy and 79% recall, while ANN reached 98% recall (though with low precision). Focused on recall to minimize false negatives and improve retention insights.
ðŸ“Š Tools: Python, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Keras
ðŸ“ˆ Metrics: Accuracy, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Identify high-risk churners and support data-driven retention strategies.
